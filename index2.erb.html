        <h2> My Covid Panel</h2>
        <p>
          These graphs are built from data collected by the New York Times as well as from the CDC.
          The NYT code is generally 24 hours old. The CDC data about excess deaths is 1 week old, but with the 
          important caveat that data newer than about 3 weeks is revised several times as time goes on so you 
          can't really rely on what you see that is more recent than 3 weeks. 
        </p>
        <p>
          These graphs and the programming were done by me, Pito Salas. Feel free to ask me for a copy! File generated at <%= Time.now %>.

            Excess deaths compare the number of reported deaths in the current period against the same 
            period last year. The concept gives an interesting view of things without actually having to
            decide what the cause of death was.
